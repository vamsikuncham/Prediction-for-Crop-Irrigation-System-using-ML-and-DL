# Prediction-for-Crop-Irrigation-System-using-ML-and-DL

Developed a prediction model. The objective is whether to water the plants or not by taking certain parameters like (soil moisture, humidity, temperature) and by taking crop type and crop days into the consideration we made the model which trains using Machine Learning and neural networks (Artificial Neural Networks ) algorithms and predicts the output.
